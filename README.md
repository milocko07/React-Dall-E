# React-Dall-E

This app demonstrates how to connect a React app (using hooks) to the [DALL-E OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction) to generate images based on audio and textual prompts. The app allows users to record the voice, transform it as input in a text prompt, send it to the DALL-E API, and display the generated image in the UI.
